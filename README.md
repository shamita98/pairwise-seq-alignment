# pairwise-seq-alignment

**Project Title:**
Implementing Pairwise Sequence Alignment Algorithm in Python

This project implements pairwise sequence alignment algorithm in Python, for comparing biological sequences. Pairwise sequence alignment is a fundamental technique in bioinformatics used to identify similarities and differences between DNA, RNA, or protein sequences. This implementation includes customizable options for scoring schemes and gap penalties.
